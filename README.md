Scientific Logging System
Goal: simplify the experiment harness and presentation pipeline in CS research.

Tasks:
[1] Logging modules for C++ and Python. 
    > hierarchical logging with XML. 
    > efficient loading, access of XML. 
    > data classification and organization. 

[2] Data visualization tool from XML log. 
    > Plotting utilities (matplotlib).

[3] LaTex Integration.
    > Generate plot directly inside latex.
    > Allow defining dynamic variables that refer to data in XML. 


Future Tasks:
[1] Extend to Java and Matlab.
[2] Remote integration: retrieve and interpret from computation servers.
[3] Custom XML parser that works even if the XML is still being writen.
